# HTN
 A hierarchical task network (HTN) planner.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Sandruski/HTN`.
2. Generate the solution by running [GenerateProjectFiles.bat](https://github.com/Sandruski/HTN/blob/main/GenerateProjectFiles.bat). By default, it is generated for Visual Studio 2022. You can change the version of Visual Studio by editing this file.
3. If you add or remove project files, regenerate the solution by rerunning [GenerateProjectFiles.bat](https://github.com/Sandruski/HTN/blob/main/GenerateProjectFiles.bat).

## Usage
The solution contains two projects, HTN and HTNTest. HTN is the planner itself and HTNTest are all the unit tests of the planner.
